# Assignment 1 - Policy evaluation
- understand value iteration from [ipynb](https://github.com/songqsh/foo1/blob/master/src/hjb_mdp_05.ipynb)
- obtain optimal policy at the end of value iteration.
- evaluate the value associated to the optimal policy from the previous step.

# Assinment 2 - Solving ODE by Neural Network
- solve the following ODE explicitly:
$$u" - 1 = 0, u(0) = u(1) = 0.$$
